# Data-Structures-Linked-List

This program implements a Radix Sort for managing and sorting strings using a doubly linked list. It offers features to load strings from an input file, sort them, dynamically add or delete strings, and save results to an output file. The program reads strings from input.txt and allows the user to view the unsorted or sorted list. Sorting is done using Radix Sort, where characters are mapped to indices for proper order, considering digits, uppercase, and lowercase letters. Users can add new strings, which are automatically sorted, or delete specific strings. The sorted list can be saved to output.txt. Core operations include file handling, linked list management, and Radix Sort implementation. A menu-driven interface provides options for all functionalities, ensuring ease of use. This program is designed to handle strings up to 30 characters and efficiently manages dynamic lists with the flexibility to load, process, and save data.
